## Perfect Number

a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.
For example, the number 28 is perfect because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.
Write a function that finds calculates if a number is a perfect number.
